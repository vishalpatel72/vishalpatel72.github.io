                    <p>Maybe you didnâ€™t know this, but standard education is not sufficient to educate your children about money! Robert is a firm advocate that academic education is going to set them up for failure! Learn what they really need and how you
                        can give it to them!

                    <p>The detailed biography of Swami Vivekananda, describing his life vividly. I read it just for ascertaining the miracles/super-human abilities (rumored to be) associated with SwamiJi & found that most of the supposed rumors which I heard
                        were actually true.

                    <p>Paulo Coelho's enchanting novel has inspired a devoted following around the world. This story, dazzling in its powerful simplicity and soul-stirring wisdom, is about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who travels from his homeland
                        in Spain to the Egyptian desert in search of a treasure buried near the Pyramids.

                    <p>Elon Musk is not exactly a name that rolls easily off the tongue, like say Tony Stark, the fictional person to whom he is most often compared, or even Steve Jobs, a real-world visionary, whose mantle Musk now wears. There is no question
                        that Musk is a special individual, someone with BIG dreams and the drive, talent, and money to make them happen

                    <div class="text ">Author : Alan W.Watts</div>
                    <p>In this fascinating book, Alan Watts explores man's quest for psychological security, examining our efforts to find spiritual and intellectual certainty in the realms of religion and philosophy. The Wisdom of Insecurity underlines
                        the importance of our search for stability in an age where human life seems particularly vulnerable and uncertain
